This repository contains lookup tables (LUTs) with colors which are unambiguous
for color blind and non-color blind humans as carefully described in [How to
make figures and presentations that are friendly to color blind
people](http://jfly.iam.u-tokyo.ac.jp/html/color_blind/) by **Masataka Okabe**
and **Kei Ito**.

I generated the files using the [LUT
Panel](http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/plugins/lut-panel.html)
([source](http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/plugins/lut-panel.html)) ImageJ plugin
developed by **Patrick Pirrotte** and **Jerome Mutterer**.
