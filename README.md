Following the careful guidelines of [How to make figures and presentations that
are friendly to color blind
people](http://jfly.iam.u-tokyo.ac.jp/html/color_blind/) described by Masataka
Okabe and Kei Ito I have created lookup tables (LUT) for the set of colors that
are unambiguous both to colorblinds and non-colorblinds.

LUTs were generated using the [LUT
Panel](http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/plugins/lut-panel.html)
([source](http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/plugins/lut-panel.html)) ImageJ plugin
developed by Patrick Pirrotte and Jerome Mutterer.
